All visuals were hand-drawn, the music was composed by me, and the sound effects were generated in bfxr. Armed with only a single weapon, the soldier must battle his way through alien swarms.\n\nThis project was an important milestone for me, as it taught me the fundamentals of building game engines and the core logic behind 2D platformers.","https://gamejolt.com/games/just-game/45096","2015-07-16T00:00+04:00",{"metadata":126,"sys":129,"fields":139},{"tags":127,"concepts":128},[],[],{"space":130,"id":132,"type":43,"createdAt":133,"updatedAt":134,"environment":135,"publishedVersion":137,"revision":138,"locale":28},{"sys":131},{"type":11,"linkType":12,"id":13},"6rKoyKeeJKkufozWQI4cLb","2023-07-02T12:20:09.602Z","2023-07-02T12:20:52.608Z",{"sys":136},{"id":20,"type":11,"linkType":21},7,2,{"title":140,"description":51,"file":141},"just-game",{"url":142,"details":143,"fileName":148,"contentType":149},"//images.ctfassets.net/4wbkioyqldjv/6rKoyKeeJKkufozWQI4cLb/49ce723512625c9b499428a0cfc74c0e/138506-ll-ytqmxrfk-v4.webp",{"size":144,"image":145},5028,{"width":146,"height":147},799,477,"138506-ll-ytqmxrfk-v4.webp","image/webp",{"tags":151},"Platformer, HTML5, Game design",{"metadata":153,"sys":156,"fields":167},{"tags":154,"concepts":155},[],[],{"space":157,"id":159,"type":15,"createdAt":160,"updatedAt":161,"environment":162,"publishedVersion":164,"revision":137,"contentType":165,"locale":28},{"sys":158},{"type":11,"linkType":12,"id":13},"6VH8QepLx1WvigsHo6Mill","2023-07-02T14:24:24.476Z","2025-08-17T23:37:59.138Z",{"sys":163},{"id":20,"type":11,"linkType":21},31,{"sys":166},{"type":11,"linkType":26,"id":27},{"title":168,"description":169,"type":32,"url":170,"date":171,"thumbnail":172,"meta":194},"Radiance Devices 2","A puzzle platformer game made in Adobe Flash in 2013.
